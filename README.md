# RT42
This is a simple raytracer created for a 42 school project using SDL2. Made by a group of five people in about one month and a half, it produces a realistic scene out of a scene file.

* SDL2 used to open window, handle inputs and draw pixels.
* Many objects can be used in the scene file (spheres, planes, cylinders, boxes, pyramides and many more).
* Lights using Phong lighting.
* Reflection, refraction, and transparency.
* Anti-aliasing.
* Procedural textures created with Perlin noise.
* Naive multithreading implementation.
* Personal file format used to create scenes.

# Usage

./rt scene_file.rt
